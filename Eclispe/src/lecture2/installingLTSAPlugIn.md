# LTSA Eclipse

Prerequisites and instructions for assisted and manual installation of the plug are availabe at [https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/ltsa/eclipse/help/index.html?installing_ltsa_eclipse.htm](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/ltsa/eclipse/help/index.html?installing_ltsa_eclipse.htm)


I am reporting key step for assisted installation below:

1. Launch Eclipse
2. Select Help->Install New Software...
3. Select the Available Software tab page.
4. type	and Add the URL [http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/ltsa/eclipse/install](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/ltsa/eclipse/install) (you can assign a name to this URL)
5.	Check the site URL name in the list of available software.
6.	Click Install (you can tick the first package and ignore the others, it is the only one needed)
7. Review install options and click Next and Accept the terms in the license agreement.
8. Review the terms in the license agreements and click Finish.
9. The Update Manager will then download the feature.
10. Restart Eclipse to enable the LTSA Eclipse feature.

Enjoy :)
